### About this application
URL shortening is used to create shorter aliases for long URLs. We call these shortened aliases “short links.” Users are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short links. Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.

For example, if we shorten this page through TinyURL:

https://www.testurl.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5649050225344512/5668600916475904/

We would get:

http://tinyurl.com/jlg8zpc

The shortened URL is nearly one-third the size of the actual URL.

URL shortening is used to optimize links across devices, track individual links to analyze audience, measure ad campaigns’ performance, or hide affiliated original URLs
